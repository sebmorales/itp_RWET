ROSE, HARSH ROSE, 
MARRED AND WITH STINT OF PETALS, 
MEAGRE FLOWER, THIN, 
SPARE OF LEAF,

MORE PRECIOUS 
THAN A WET ROSE 
SINGLE ON A STEM -- 
YOU ARE CAUGHT IN THE DRIFT.

STUNTED, WITH SMALL LEAF, 
YOU ARE FLUNG ON THE SAND, 
YOU ARE LIFTED 
IN THE CRISP SAND 
THAT DRIVES IN THE WIND.

CAN THE SPICE-ROSE 
DRIP SUCH ACRID FRAGRANCE 
HARDENED IN A LEAF?
