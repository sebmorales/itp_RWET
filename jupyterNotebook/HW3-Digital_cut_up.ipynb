       "['Cybernetic Bacteria is an ongoing trans- disciplinary investigation which brings together art, philosophy, microbiology and digital technology to examine the relationship of the emerging science of bacterial communication to our own digital communications networks, look- ing in particular at “packet data” and bacterial quorum sensing. The project was developed within the context of Dumitriu’s ongoing research into micro- biology and more specifically her re- search involving normal flora bacteriology through art practice.',\n",
       " 'The project is framed within Dumitriu’s role as artist in residence in The Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics (CCNR) at The University of Sussex, which places her at the heart of one of the largest artificial life (AL) research groups in the world. The prima- ry concern of the group is trying to understand what actually constitutes life and attempting to model it, or even recreate it through artificial processes (which are generally computational but could include wet processes too). For many researchers there, life can be considered an abstract concept, not directly linked to biological processes. Through her residency, which started in 2006, she is able to research complex systems through simulation and modeling. In particular she is concerned with evolutionary and adaptive computational systems to which bacteria (as the simplest living organisms) are strongly relevant [1].',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Dumitriu’s collaborators in Cybernetic Bacteria are Simon Park, a microbiologist based at The University of Surrey, Blay Whitby, a philosopher specializing in artificial intelligence and ethics, Tom Keene, a freelance interactive media artist, and Lorenzo Grespan, a freelance programmer specialising in artificial life and computational neuroscience.',\n",
       " 'Bacteria and Communication',\n",
       " 'The initial ideas for working with chemical communication stemmed from a discussion between Dumitriu and Park about bacterial communication and new insights recently discovered by Bonnie Bassler at Princeton University. Bassler studies a phenomenon called quorum sensing in bacteria, which she describes as:',\n",
       " 'Bassler’s work has shown that bacteria are continually sending messages to each other, in the form of bursts of hormones (such as Homoserine lactones) and other signaling chemicals. They are also able to communicate to any eukaryotic animal or plant cell (and in some cases affect their structure also). As Lynn Margulis and Doran Sagan stated, “Life did not take over the globe by combat, but by networking\" [3].',\n",
       " '“a process that allows bacteria to communicate using secreted chemical signaling molecules called autoinducers. This process enables a population of bacteria to collectively regulate gene expression and, therefore, behavior” [2].',\n",
       " 'Intricate bacterial communication techniques, such as quorum sensing, chemotactic signaling (detecting harmful or favourable substances in the environment), and plasmid exchange (e.g. for transfer of antibiotic resistance genes) are now being investigated as a form of social intelligence as it is realized that these so called ‘simplest’ of life forms can work collectively, obtain information about their environment and use that information in meaningful ways.',\n",
       " 'This means that bacteria are able to pass signals between them in relatively complex ways. The simplest form of this is by signaling their presence within the colony, a message which effectively states: “I’m here”, through a burst of hormone.',\n",
       " 'To enable this level of complexity, bacteria communicate using a wide range of different biochemical agents and use intricate intercellular signaling mechanisms. Research continues into how precisely these messages are being sent and received, but the potential of that research is surely clear. If we can decode the bacteria’s communication signals, then we can communicate with them and perhaps ask them to behave in different ways. Bacterial communication offers the potential of a powerful new direction in infection control, which as the power of antibiotics continues to dwindle in efficacy seems increasingly attractive.',\n",
       " 'Cybernetics',\n",
       " 'The messages bacteria pass can have a global impact, as they are able to send signals to one another, theoretically ad infinitum, and learn through their inter- actions. This phenomenon is well de- scribed by the field of cybernetics, which is the interdisciplinary study of the structure of complex systems, especially communication processes, control mechanisms and feedback principles, often using computational methods.',\n",
       " 'Complex Networks',\n",
       " 'The way in which bacterial life threads across our planet, through the soil, the water and the ice, constantly passing messages and flagging its effective message of “I’m here” to other bacteria, forms a complex and diverse network of microbial life, particularly in terms of ability to communicate. This is very much echoed within human digital communications networks such as the Internet. Data traffic travels through the Internet by being routed through active nodes, which flag their activity by streaming “packet data” signals, which also effectively say: “I am here” and “I am active”.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Since 1959 all complex networks have been treated as randomized networks, based on the work of Paul Erdos and Alfred Renyi, who were studying net- works seen in life sciences. They believed that such complex networks could be modeled by connecting nodes with',\n",
       " 'randomly set links, which produced a highly democratic system with nodes in the network having more or less the same number of links. So when in 1998 a project to map the world wide web was undertaken, the researchers, who included Albert-László Barabási, anticipated that a randomized network would be found. But this was not to be the case, the results actually showed that, although most nodes had just a few links, there were in fact a small number of highly connected nodes, which they called “hubs” and in this sense the network can be described as having no scale, as being a “scale-free network”. Scale-free net- works have also been observed in the bacteria such as Escherichia coli at a cellular level in their metabolic networks [4].',\n",
       " 'Cybernetic Bacteria 2.0',\n",
       " 'Cybernetic Bacteria 2.0 is a multiple screen projection, that makes explicit the correlations between bacterial and human communications networks dis- cussed earlier. The work combines, in real time, the raw network traffic taking place live around the gallery (including web traffic, mobile technology and Blue- tooth) and data from a time-lapse film of bacterial communication occurring (involving two strains of genetically modified [GM] bacteria, which will indicate, by changing colour or glowing, the communication taking place). From those two sources a new cellular automata artificial life form based on Conway’s ‘Game of Life’ was generated [5].',\n",
       " 'To create this work a purple bacterium called Chromobacterium violaceum was used. This bacterium emits and detects a chemical signal. When a population hits a critical density, the concentration of the chemical signal reaches a threshold, which the bacterium is able to detect responding by turning on production of the purple pigment. The white coloured, genetically modified form Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 was also used to detect chemical signals and responded by producing a purple pigment also, but it cannot produce the chemical signal itself. The other bacterium used was Serratia marcescens; it is also able to send out signals but cannot communicate to the CV026. Colonies of this bacterium are a striking red colour due to the production of the pigment prodigiosin.',\n",

       " \"environment. Each time a new device was discovered (from touch and remote RFID tags, Bluetooth devices and wire- less activity) its unique ID was recorded and sent to a computer generating artificial life in a variation of Conway's Game of Life. The data is used as a trigger to turn on a small burst of coloured pixels at a random location on the screen.\",\n",
       " 'The presence of new pixels affects the global behaviour of the game, as in the original Game of Life, and echoes the behaviour of the bacteria, each pixel stays on or is turned on if and only if two or three neighbouring pixels are also on. Furthermore, white pixels become purple if they have a purple neighbour. Red pixels do not affect other pixels’ colour but only their on/off state.',\n",
       " 'Conclusion',\n",
       " 'The artworks described here attempt to investigate the relationship between digital and bacterial communications net- works. The research takes a threefold approach by combining artistic, philosophical and scientific methodologies through a transdisciplinary approach (focussing on microbiology and artificial life disciplines in science). They look at parallels with scale-free networks in both digital and bacterial communications networks and to do so they use performativity and participation in order to engage the audience with a visceral sense of the vast, complex, unseen communications networks that surround them.']"
