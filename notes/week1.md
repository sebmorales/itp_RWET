### Luring people into nonsense
"The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things
as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of
art is to make objects "unfamiliar," to make forms difficult, to
increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process
of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged.
Art is a way of experiencing the artfulness of an object: the object
is not important..." [Viktor Shklovsky](https://paradise.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/Viktor_Sklovski_Art_as_Technique.pdf)

### To make a Dadaist poem (Tristan Tzara):

* Take a newspaper.
* Take a pair of scissors.
* Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.
* Cut out the article.
* Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in a bag.
* Shake it gently.
* Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they left the bag.
* Copy conscientiously.
* <b> The poem will be like you.</b>
* And here you are a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the vulgar.

With a computer you can make nonsense very fast. Iterate and giving it meaning
